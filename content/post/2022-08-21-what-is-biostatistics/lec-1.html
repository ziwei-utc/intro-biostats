<h1>A Motivation Example</h1>
<p><img src="example-1.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Pancreatic cancer has a very poor survival rate because it is often detected too late</li>
<li>A new app promises to detect early symptoms of jaundice that may go unnoticed typically</li>
<li>Should this “test” be adopted into routine practice?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div id="what-was-the-evidence-behind-this-optimistic-headline" class="section level2">
<h2>What was the evidence behind this optimistic headline?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In an initial study the app detected cases of “concern” correctly 89.7% of the time, and
classified “negative” cases correctly 96.8% of the time</p></li>
<li><p>The reference test was based on the total serum bilirubin level</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="what-would-a-data-detective-ask" class="section level2">
<h2>What would a data detective ask?</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are the statistical methods appropriate?</li>
<li>Is the study design appropriate?</li>
<li>Is there information external to the study that affects its interpretation?</li>

<div id="evaluating-the-quality-of-the-statistical-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Evaluating the quality of the statistical methods</h1>
<ul>
<li>Is the study large enough?</li>
<li>What is the uncertainty around the reported results?</li>
<li>Were relevant statistics recorded?</li>
<li>Do the statistics provided help make a decision about the next step?</li>

<div id="evaluating-the-quality-of-the-statistical-methods-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluating the quality of the statistical methods</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Notice that the certainty we have in our conclusions depends on the sample size.
The extreme results were less convincing when the sample size was reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>What sample size is needed to draw a definitive conclusion? That needs to be determined
using appropriate statistical methods to obtain the desired precision. We will study this in
following lectures.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="evaluating-the-quality-of-the-study-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluating the quality of the study design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Are the subjects in the study representative?</li>
<li>Is the reference standard relevant?</li>
<li>Are the subjects in the study representative?
<ul>
<li>Healthy volunteers and patients from a medical centre were used
-If the test accuracy is systematically better or worse in these patients than in patients
on whom the test will be used, then the results are biased</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is the reference standard relevant?
<ul>
<li>Bilirubin level is a measure of jaundice, but not all cases of jaundice have pancreatic
cancer</li>
<li>If the accuracy of the test with respect to bilirubin level is systematically different from
the accuracy with respect to pancreatic cancer, then our results may be biased</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Bias vs. Precision</h2>
<p><img src="bias-precision.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Precision results in a random departure from the true value</p></li>
<li><p>Bias is a systematic departure from the true value</p></li>
<li><p>A large sample size can improve precision but not bias. Study design and analysis could
reduce bias</p></li>
